# ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) Retrospective: 2025 North America Mid-Atlantic Regional
**Date:** 11/8/2025
**Division:** 2 (Virginia Tech Site)
**Team Result:** Solved 5 Problems | ~50th Percentile
**Experience Level:** First ever programming competition.

## Executive Summary
This was my first experience in a competitive programming environment. Despite having no prior contest experience, our team placed in the 50th percentile. I successfully solo-solved the initial problems to clear the way for my teammates and spent the remainder of the contest tackling complex logical and counting problems in order to help my team mates solve them.

## Key Takeaways
* **Adaptation:** Transitioned from a coding to a problem solving mindset through the contest. Allowed for deeper analysis of the problems.
* **Solo Solved:**
    * **Snakey String:** Successfully implemented an iterative string-building solution by parsing input sequences in python.
    * **Memories of Passport Control:** Solved a more logic focused problem by translating abstract requirements into a clean, functional implementation in python.
* **Strategic Contribution:** Took ownership of the "Easy" problems early on, allowing the more experienced team members to focus on difficult problems.

## Deep Dive on Much Room for Mushrooms
**This problem was the primary focus of my second half of the contest.**
* **The Challenge:** Required deriving a formula/ruleset for mushroom growth patterns and counting the amount possibly viewed.
* **The Process:** I utilized a manual whiteboarding approach, drawing out various test cases to identify logical constraints.
* **Lessons Learned:** I correctly identified the "conditional logic" required (If X, then Y). However, I struggled with the final counting implementation involving parity (even/odd) and combinatorics (study of counting). I was on the right track, but lacked the specific mathematical implementation to close the loop.

## Team Strategy & Dynamics
* **The Approach:** We used whats called a Parallel Execution strategy. I handled the foundation while my teammates worked on advanced problems.
* **The Takeaway:** While working separately is efficient, it requires high individual competency in **prioritization**. In the future, I aim to take a stronger leadership role in managing the team's "Problem Queue" to ensure we don't over-invest time in the wrong areas.

## Growth Plan for Next Competition
1.  **Algorithms:** Transition from coding to implementing standard algorithms from memory.
2.  **Leadership:** Develop the confidence to guide team prioritization and time management.
3.  **Advanced Problem Sets:** Move beyond the Easy/Medium tier in Kattis practice to get comfortable with more complex problem sets.
